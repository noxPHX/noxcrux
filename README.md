# noxcrux
noxcrux is a Django web app and API which allows you to create and store passwords horcruxes to improve your online security.  

## Introduction
The persons intended by this project are people who are a minimum aware of online security risks and at least use a password manager.  

noxcrux was inspired by [this article](https://kaizoku.hashnode.dev/double-blind-passwords-aka-horcruxing#double-blind-passwords-aka-horcruxing) and the concept of horcruxes from the universe of Harry Potter.  
The aim of this project is to split passwords in multiple horcruxes to mitigate the single point of failure risk induced by password managers.  

The project is still in early development stage (see [Features](#features) and [Todo list](#todo-list) below) but the end goal is to offer to the users multiple noxcrux' servers to connect to and distribute their online accounts access security to different places.  
At the moment there is no live demo of this project so if you are interested in using it you need to set it up yourself for one or multiple servers ([instructions](#getting-started) below).  

A web extension will be later developed to allow end users to easily manage their noxcrux' servers and to retrieve and assemble their complete password when they want to login to a website.
